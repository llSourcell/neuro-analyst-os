# Neuro-Analyst OS

An open-source toolkit to make brain data analysis simple, beautiful, and reproducible for everyone.

## Mission

The goal of this project is to create the world's most intuitive and powerful software for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing EEG/BCI data. We believe that by making the tools better, we can accelerate the pace of discovery in neuroscience.

## Status

**Pre-Alpha.** This project is in the very early stages of development. The foundation is being laid for a Q4 2025 public release.
